# PipeCast

PipeCast is an attempt to bring the behaviours seen in popular streaming audio mixers and tools to Linux, in a way
that's simple to use and familiar to those moving from other platforms.

## This project is still in Early Development!

At this point in time there's nothing here which is usable for a regular user. Things will develop over time and become
more usable, but for now it's probably worth holding tight until then.
