# PipeCast

**PipeCast** is an audio management tool for Linux built on top of [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org), designed
specifically with streamers in mind.

It provides a simple way to create, route, control, and manage audio devices â€” making it easy to send different audio
sources (for example, Microphones, Games or Music) to different outputs (Headphones, Discord, OBS) with minimal hassle.

Configuration of PipeCast is done via a simple Web
Page ([reasoning here](https://github.com/PipeCast/pipecast/wiki/Why-a-Web-Page%3F)) ensuring the UI is available
wherever you need it.

## This project is still in Early Development!

At this point in time there's nothing here which is usable for a regular user. Things will develop over time and become
more usable, but for now it's probably worth holding tight until then.
